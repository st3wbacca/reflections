When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you wanted to share your code with others. It would also back up your
    code somewhere offsite.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may be working on code and you don't want that overwritten
	before you have a chance to commit those changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of someone else's repository from GitHub up to a certain commit.
	It will appear on your GitHub. A clone is a local copy of a repository from GitHub.
	A branch of a is a specific version of code within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To know how you've changed the code since you last got it. You can also fetch
	and merge any new commits with yours.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Well there are other version control software out there. I'm sure I could learn
	them too.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
